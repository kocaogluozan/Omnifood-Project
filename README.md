# Omnifood-Project

This is the final project of the Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS by Jonas Schmedtmann udemy course. I completed this 37.5 hours course.I had opportunity 
to learn Modern, semantic and accessible HTML5 and Modern CSS, including flexbox and CSS Grid for layout.In addition, I used media quarries to make the website responsive. Finally i use some javascript to create sticky navigation,smooth scrolling
and keeping the site update.
