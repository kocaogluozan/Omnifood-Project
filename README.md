# Omnifood-Project

This is the final project of the 37.5 hours Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS by Jonas Schmedtmann udemy course.I had opportunity 
to learn Modern, semantic and accessible HTML5 and modern CSS, including flexbox and CSS grid for layout.In addition, I used media quarries to make the website responsive. Finally i use some javascript to create sticky navigation,smooth scrolling
and keeping the site update.
